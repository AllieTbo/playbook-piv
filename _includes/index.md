#### What is a PIV card?

A Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card is a reliable, government-wide identity credential used to access Federally controlled facilities and information systems at the appropriate security level.

The release of <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/homeland-security-presidential-directive-12">HSPD-12</a> in 2004 outlined the requirements for a common identification standard for identity credentials issued by Federal departments and agencies to Federal employees and contractors. <a href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.201-2.pdf">Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201</a>, entitled Personal Identity Verification of Federal Employees and Contractors, was developed to satisfy the requirements outlined in HSPD 12, and defines the technical requirements for PIV cards, an identity credential that:

- is issued based on sound criteria for verifying an individual employeeâ€™s identity;
- is strongly resistant to identity fraud, tampering, counterfeiting, and terrorist exploitation;
- can be rapidly authenticated electronically; and
- is issued only by providers whose reliability has been established by an official accreditation process.

FIPS 201 addresses requirements for initial identity proofing, infrastructures to support interoperability of identity credentials, and accreditation of organizations and processes issuing PIV credentials.
